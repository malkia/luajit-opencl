OpenCL bindings for LuaJIT using the FFI module

The bindings are based on the reference header file from Khronos:
http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/api/1.1/cl.h

The bindings were preprocessed using "gcc -E", and I've semi-automatically replaced "#define CL_xxxx value" to "enum CL_xxx value"

Once you have compiled luajit (32-bit tested only), test it like this:

luajit opencl-info.lua
luajit opencl-demo.lua
